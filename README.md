# ovpn-dashboard

Web frontend for openvpn sever

Enables simple creation of client config files, either for dial-up or site-to-site scenarios, allows for certificate management/revoking, gives an overview of general system status and openVPN-specific information, enables easy backup/restore of server config and editing of current configuration (you will still need to restart the openvpn service, but you can do that from the web frontend as well)
